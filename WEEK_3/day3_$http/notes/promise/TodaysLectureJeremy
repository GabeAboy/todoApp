Making a web request which is going to someone elses comp and getting information

way we say where in computer lang is by using URL

$http comes with a promise <=== we handle the promise by using .then()

.then interprets results and then does another call from the callback.

CRUD <=== create read update delete

API<=====application program interface <==== whats another word for application? Program!
  Program Program interface

{client}<==|api|==>[[server]]<====>((((database))))

$http is going through the web to request information

api is part of the server where we are allowed to access information the rest would be private

XML <==== is where HTML comes from.

How do you check to see if all your HTML files are valid HTML ? GOOGLE.

JSON => only takes basic data types <======= can't put functions or undefined <===never put functions inside JSON
having a JSON object with a function will tell the other program that is using it how to behave (not good) those are called trojans/worms/virus

angular.fromJson - Deserializes a JSON string.

does angular automatically parse the JSON object when returned a promised HTTP call ???? <===== good question <=== google or check lecture video

What is ReST? < ==== its a protocol or set of rules for establishing a communication between two programs

'?' in url acts like a filter <==== chains to the url

rest is a protocol to exchange (XML and JSON) messages <==== rest is url format <====rest is the verb which is used in HTTP protocols method names GET, POST,

Rest is the way we should use HTTP dictates the usage of DELETE to erase behind URL. where as we would misuuse a GET or POST query like ... product/?delete_id=22 without REST.

POST <===== CREATE

GET<====== READ

PUT <===== UPDATE

REMOVE<==== DELETE

REST enforces the use of available HTTP commands as theey were meant to be used

===================================================Ways we pass information through the URL==================================================

Three ways params, query, body <=== Body : {object}

passing body ====>  example.
                          var promise == $http({
                              url:'https://url.com',
                              method:'post',
This is the body     ====>    data: {name: 'mee Sir'}
                              })

=========================================================

two things that we response is going to give us is the preoperties of ====> data and status <==== status will likely be a code(200, 404, 500) etc.
