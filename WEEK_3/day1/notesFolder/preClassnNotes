ngOptions attribute can be used to generate a list of <option> elements for the <select> element using the array of object obtained by evaluating ngOtions.

In many cases, ngRepeat can be used on <option> elements instead of ngOptions.

Benefits:

    more flexibility in how the select's model is assigned via the select as part of the comprehension expression.

    reduced memory consumption by not creating a new scope for each repeated instance.

    increased render speed bu creating options in a documentFragment instead of individually

when item in select menu is selected the array element or obj prop represented by selected option will be bound to the model identified by ng-model

optionally a single hard coded option element with the value set to an empty string can be nested into the select element, the obj will then represent null or not selected option

By default ngModel watches the model reference, not value. this is important when binding the select tot a model that is an obj or collection
