Seperation of concerns

$log,$http <=== params for .controller(function($scope,$log,$http))

as we are adding properties to our $scope object through html and view <=== angular flags the data <=== digest cycle tends to digest things properly <=== constantly looping through and looking for changes
$scope.$watch is already a property on the scope object

    $scope.$watch('ourData',function(){
     var newItem = $scope.ourData;
     
    })
