Ui- router and states

when in home state state what it looks like underneath and the controller

we load index page one time.

  1.we need to go into js and put the things in the folder

  2.where we actually at

  3.what we are putting in

1.We need to bring in library for ui router

2.We place the module name in our module bracket 'angualar.module('myApp',['ui-router'])'
  some other ones are ng-animate, ui-bootstrap, quite a few

3.Tell it where to show on the screen ===> <ui-view></ui-view>  <==== this is what ui-router is looking for

4.we need to put more info into our app.js file
    we are adding

    .config(function($stateProvider,$urlRouterProvider){
    $stateProvider
      .state('home', {
          url:'/',
          template:'<h4>we are home </h4>' <=====to put a file here we replace 'template' with 'templateUrl' and put in our filepath<====refactoring
          }
      })
    $stateProvider
      .state('home', {
          url:'/',
          templateURl:'./list.html',
          controller: 'listController' <==== do we need to put the file path with .js?<==== maybe we put the name of our chosen controller
          }
      })
    $stateProvider
      .state('home', {
          url:'/details/',
          templateURl:'./list.html',
          controller: 'listController' <==== do we need to put the file path with .js?<==== maybe we put the name of our chosen controller
          }
      })

    })

    http://1234.124.1221/#/ <==== this is deep urls and deeplinking which is creating a subUrl and telling our page anything after this('#') is not going to a new page

  our templates can use angular

  master-detail patter ===> mastr list than tkaes us to a abigger list full of items
