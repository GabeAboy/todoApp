Services

  dependency injection < === practice of registering constructor functions with a central source by name

      service1 can also use service2 which will come wherever service1 is injected

      'this' <=== when we are building a service <=== a service is a contstructor function that is building and object

      only get one copy of a service;

      controller is to collect all data for the view and construct the data for the view


When adding a new property to an object without assigning it a value, the value will returned undefined.
  Now if we want to change the value to a boolean we can say 'friends[userIndex] = !friends[userIndex]' which will change it to NOT UNDEFINED which is true and if we keep activating this action it will continually change the value from true to false

  jquery can either be used in it's very own js file or as a directive in angular when used with angular in an app.
