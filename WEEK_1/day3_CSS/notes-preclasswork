Since box-sizing is pretty new, you should use the -webkit- and -moz- prefixes for now, as I have in these examples. This technique enables experimental features in specific browsers. Also, keep in mind that this one is IE8+.

STATIC~
static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.

anything outside of static is said to be positioned

RELATIVE
relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.

CLEAR
The clear property is important for controlling the behavior of floats.

clear:left, right

overflow: auto to handle any type of overflow from a parent container

inline-block <===== use inline-block instead of using float the hard way to get elements to align.

inline block elemenets are affected by the vertical-align property so we probably want to set them to top middle, or bottom
