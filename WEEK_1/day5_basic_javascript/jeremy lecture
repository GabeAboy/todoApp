Javascript Fundamentals

Client server model
  distributed system

word processors <==== operating system(server)<====>file1.docx

word processor =====> renders =======> page

works in binary ===> 1's and 0's
files can be remote computer anywhere in the world.

all files don't finish loading at the same time.

protocol ===> http

Domain name ===> google.com

/index.html ===> File

browser fetches 6 files at a time

by default, JAVASCRIPT BLOCKS meaning it will freeze the whole page when a script tag is displayed and then run the script tag and then after the script is done running then the page will continure running

script tags go at the bottom of the body so that everything else loads before the script tag runs because the script tag blocks.

prevent script blocking HTML5<==== async attribute loads all javascript files at a time

defer attribute <==== loads at the end of the body

 DOM is critical in making any webpage work
staging area for all the peices to be put together and set so the browser can start rendering

Debugger is chrome's representation of the DOM

every browser has window.document in order to accesss the window in browser

if we are checking data we can set it to null to let us knoow wer already checked it

null means nothing ON PURPOSE

cases in comparing a str and a num it converts the num into a str

everything can be converted into a str

FALSE VS FALSY

0, '', undef, null ,false , NaN

Keep it DRY
don't repeat yourself
