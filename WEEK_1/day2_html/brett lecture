WHAT IS THE BOX MODEL?



goal is to know what html is and css is.

how they work together.

!Doctype Html <==== tells the browser that this is the html page.

meta tag is information about information

utf-8 is binary coding

body tag is all the things that will be rendered by our page


HTML and CSS

hypertext markup language

html gives structure like a house frame.

gives shape and structure

html elements look to other elements to predict what their shape should be

% vs Px ===> pixels is more specific, % looks to the parent container

we can start using semantic tags  ====> <section> <footer> <header>

CSS PROPERTIES ===> giving our pages rules

position:relative ======> is what we use for position 'absolute' to attached/attract itself to!!

****vertical-align? how to use? we use 'line height'

box-sizing : border-box <====== it will give us the exact amount of height and width and add padding but track size of content so that it will not be any bigger than i gave it.

border-box ===>w and h include content, padding, and border. NOT MARGIN.

we can use border-box to set as a default setting

****BY DEFAULT everything contains CONTENT-BOX ****

When you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, the padding and border of that element no longer increase its width.

content-box w and h include only content  .border padding and margin not included.

FLOAT AND CLEAR ====>

view width <===== vw and vh

calc(100%/3) <===== calculate width or more!. css functions
