If we need to manipulate our view we should use a directive ==> used to manipulate the DOM

.directive takes two arguments ==> the name of our directive and a callback function
it will return an object
object has a property called 'restrict' which will determine whether our directive will be an element,attribute,or class or all 3.
second property will be a template or templateUrl

when angular fires up is when our browser gets to our first script tag.
angular file loaded in nanoseconds
it will start looking for ng-app which will tell our browser where angular starts
second it will be looking for ng-contrller to find out which block of code angular will be in control of
third it will be looking for mistache brackets

at the same time angular will be looking for changes and adjusting the DOM to the changes

ng-show takes a boolean

link function is what we are going to use to manipulate the dOM.
 introduced in 2009

rule is that we are not to do any jquery inside of angular it is best to use angular link to manip DOm

angular provided JQlite which is a library which includes the major parts of jQuery library

DOM traversal

different ways we can send information to a directive

restrict:'AE' <==== using an attribute will take up a new block in the html

Two way binding '=' means that our directive and our parent controller are in constant communication any changes will be reflected both in the controller and inside the directive

two-way data binding '=' means that we can change the value inside of the controller while we change the value of our directive where they both meet which is on the index.html page
